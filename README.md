A simple JavaScript calculator created with React.js. This project made use of the context API and useReducer hooks. Could probably have been made without employing such tools but I decided to use them to familiarise myself with them. The project is available at https://infallible-mcnulty-31f2b4.netlify.app

## Shalom!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
